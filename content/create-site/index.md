> You currently need to own an existing Airbnb listing to generate your booking site.

### Add a new site

When you are on the [Sites](https://app.myror.co/sites) page, click on **"New site from Airbnb"** button or follow directly this [link](https://app.myror.co/start).

### Choose a name and paste an Airbnb Listing URL

To generate a booking site with one first room, you simply need to **choose a site name** and **paste a link to an Airbnb listing**. The booking site content (texts and images) will be generated using the data provided by the Airbnb listing. You will be able to add/remove rooms and modify website content later so you can pick any Airbnb listing that you want to showcase on your site.

Your site name must be in small letters and can only contain alphanumeric caracters as well as dashes and underscores.
Make also sure that the link to your Airbnb listing has the following format: `https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/...`
